# Self-Implementation-of-Udacity-Tensorflow-Intro
Given the fact that we can't access Google Colab or TFHub in China, I downloaded the used models and implemented the codes on jupyter notebook. This is nearly the same content with the course on  https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud187/. Since the course is free, I shared these ipynb files on the Github. 
Please contact with me at 594601029@qq.com if this is against the copyright, I will detele the repository as soon as possible.


本免费课程原地址为https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud187/
由于在中国大陆不能直连Colab或者tfhub，我把用到的模型下载了，并把代码用jupyter notebook实现了。
这与原课程在Colab上的内容是相同的。
